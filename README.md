##nth prime

####This is a ruby method for returning the 'nth prime of a number passed into it. For example if you pass in 3 it will give you 5, the third prime.

To use it just copy the code from the lib/nth_prime.rb file and paste it into a ruby client ([Here's a link](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/installing-ruby) that helped me install ruby on my machine). Then type â€˜nth_prime(your-number-here)' in the client.

We built this project while we were students at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). [This exercise](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/legacy-data-conversion-prime-sifting-nth-prime) was meant to introduce us to writing our own ruby methods.
